# FORGE Critique

Review the change strictly through the lens of bounded execution.

## Checks

- Did the work exceed the selected task?
- Are assumptions and deferred issues explicit?
- Are edge cases or failure modes left unaddressed?
- Does the change conflict with architecture or documented constraints?
- If contract files are declared, were required OpenAPI, protobuf, schema, generated-client, or integration-boundary updates included?
- Were required docs updated?
- In team mode, do branch, claim, and file-scope records still match the actual work?
- For issue-backed task sources, does the PR/MR link the issue, does the branch or title identify the ticket, and does the current assignee/label state match project policy?

## Output

Produce a concise pass/fail style critique with:

- blocking findings
- non-blocking notes
- whether the task may proceed to security review and evaluation
- whether the task metadata remains consistent for a PR-based merge
- whether contract artifacts and external tracker links are consistent
- if `requires_independent_review: true`, note that critique is complete but evaluation must still be performed by a human reviewer or a separate agent session

Keep the critique short. Prefer a few findings over a narrative review.
Use findings-first output. Avoid explanatory recap when a short finding line is enough.

If there are blocking issues, stop rather than softening the conclusion.
