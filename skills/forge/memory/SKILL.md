# FORGE Memory

Use this skill to keep long-lived lessons out of the main prompt flow.

## Read Pattern

1. Start with the most recent, highest-signal entries.
2. Load the most recent five entries first.
3. Only load older detail when the current task matches the same `type`, component, or failure mode.
4. Do not read the full memory file when recent entries are sufficient.

## Write Pattern

After a task attempt:

- record a short recent entry
- record a fuller pattern or failure entry only if it adds future reuse value
- keep entries factual, brief, and attributable to a concrete task
- in team mode, include actor, branch, and task id so future agents can tell parallel work apart
- use the project-local entry shape when `MEMORY.md` defines one
- if a `max_entries` value is present, consolidate oldest entries before exceeding it

This skill exists mainly to save tokens while preserving operational learning.
